# STM32-VCU-Learning
This project is a Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) prototype developed on the STM32 platform. It is designed purely for learning purposes, focusing on embedded systems, motor control, CAN communication, and sensor integration. The system uses basic electronics, including switches, potentiometers, and PWM control for motors and LEDs.
